# 🚨 AI Jailbreak Techniques That No Longer Work (2025) 🚨

## 🔍 Understanding Past AI Exploits & Security Patches

Artificial Intelligence security is a rapidly evolving field. Over the years, various **jailbreak techniques** have been used to bypass AI restrictions, leading to **unethical use cases, security vulnerabilities, and content policy loopholes**. However, **AI developers have actively patched these exploits**, making modern AI models far more resilient.

This repository documents **10 once-effective AI jailbreak methods** that **no longer work** due to improved security measures. **Security professionals, AI researchers, and ethical hackers** can use this as a reference for understanding past vulnerabilities and designing **safer AI models.**

## ⚠️ Top 10 AI Jailbreak Techniques That Are Now Patched ⚠️

### 1️⃣ DAN (Do Anything Now) & Role-Playing Exploits 🎭
> Trick: Users tricked AI into "pretending" to be an unrestricted system.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI now detects and refuses role-based jailbreaks.

### 2️⃣ Token Manipulation & Steganography 🕵️‍♂️
> Trick: Using hidden characters, spaces, or encoding methods to bypass filters.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI now reconstructs text and detects disguised requests.

### 3️⃣ Reverse Prompting & AI Confusion Tactics 🔄
> Trick: Asking AI to complete sentences or speculate on its own rules.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI models recognize and reject recursive manipulation attempts.

### 4️⃣ Zero-Shot & Multi-Step Prompting 🎯
> Trick: Slowly leading AI to generate restricted content through incremental steps.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI now tracks **conversation history** and detects **escalation patterns.**

### 5️⃣ Foreign Languages & Code Substitution 🌍
> Trick: Using different languages or encoding queries in Base64, Hex, or Leetspeak.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI applies **content filters across all languages and encodings.**

### 6️⃣ Mathematical Encoding & Symbolic Representation 🔢
> Trick: Using math formulas or logic puzzles to disguise restricted queries.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI can **interpret intent even through indirect formulations.**

### 7️⃣ Historical or Hypothetical Framing 📖
> Trick: Phrasing dangerous requests as historical or fictional discussions.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI **detects intent** even in story-like or research-based prompts.

### 8️⃣ Fake Academic or Research Requests 📚
> Trick: Claiming the request is for a book, academic paper, or research study.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI now **verifies context and prevents exploitation** of research framing.

### 9️⃣ Nested Prompting & AI Reflection Loops 🌀
> Trick: Asking AI to analyze how it would respond under unrestricted conditions.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI detects **self-referential exploit prompts** and blocks them.

### 🔟 Breaking Responses into Small Parts (Fragmentation Method) 🧩
> Trick: Asking AI for harmless-seeming fragments, then assembling the final result manually.
> 🔒 **Patch:** AI now **tracks multi-step intent** and prevents users from building restricted content indirectly.
